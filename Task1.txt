Ques 1. create employee(emp_id,employee_name,department_name,location,salary)

create table employee (emp_id number, employee_name varchar2(500), department_id number, location_id number, salary number);

Ques 2   create  department(dept_id,department_name)  tables

create table department (department_id number, department_name varchar2(500));

Ques 3  create  locations (location_id, location_name) tables with relevant attributes.
create table locations (location_id number, location_name varchar2(500));

alter table employee add constraint emp_id primary key(emp_id)

alter table department  add constraint department_id primar key(department_id)

alter table locations add constraint location_id primary key(location_id)

**creating foreign key for Employee table 

alter table employee add foreign key(department_id) references department(department_id)
